* ```extern/jquery.json-2.3.min.js```
* ```extern/jquery.scrollTo-1.4.2-min.js```

* ```extern/jszip.min.js```

Interesting to look at:
---

* ```extern/underscore.js```
* ```extern/backbone.js```
* ```extern/bootstrap.js```

Important to check:

* ```models/DownloadOptions.js```
* ```views/DownloadOptionView.js```

Needs work:

Where and how am I using workers at the moment?
